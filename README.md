# DistributedProtocols
Experiments in implementing distributed protocols with Scala and Akka.

Contains simplistic implementation of the following protocols and tests for them:

* 2/3 decentralized consensus
* Two-Phase Commit (with a centralized coordinator)

You will need the SBT tool (available in MacPorts). To build and test, run `sbt test`.
