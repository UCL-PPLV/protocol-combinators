Working notes and things to implement for as protocol combinators
=================================================================

1. The "blend" combinator packaging together multiple messages

A seemingly reasonable approach is to refactor wrapSend into just returning the messages and the recipient,
for the top-level combinator to decide what to do with them. Then it should be able to bundle multiple proposals
together and send the acceptors combined messages.

We can also explicitly split the proposer to the quorum-collecting and quorum-using phase.

2. Extensions for the stoppable Paxos

What should be the decomposition of Paxos roles for this?
