More combinators for approximating Mencius
=====================================================

Follow the scenario described in Section 4

1. Implement optimization with skipping certain slots (instance) when
receiving a propose request for a larger slots;

  Try to cast it as a dependency between slots.
  

2. Do not send those messages separately, but rather package them
   together. Explore this as another instance of batching.

=====================================================

What the final language looks like?

It's a sequential programming over a sequence of commands, executed by
a series of consensus instances. The top-level programs should follow
certain laws, mandated by the consensus, and it's up to us to provide
an optimized back-end.

The top-level idea: proving consensus optimizations correct.

A framework for proving optimizations correct.

What are VCs? Something along the line of reachability with STSs, consensus and monotonicity.
